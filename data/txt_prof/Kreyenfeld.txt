Professor of… 	Sociology 

I am a Professor of Sociology at the Hertie School. My background is that of a sociologist and a demographer. I am interested in core social policy topics (such as social inequality, social mobility) as well as typical demographic themes (such as migration, family, aging, life course research). One of my key interests is the question of how social policies influence behaviour. In my projects, I mostly use micro-level data, in particular longitudinal data.  

I am open to a wide range of MA projects that touch any sociological or demographic topic. To give examples of areas that I would supervise: migration, family, aging, social inequality, social mobility, education, labour markets and the family, gender roles, (political) attitudes, life course research.  
I am particularly interested in projects that use micro-level data, such as the German SocioEconomic Panel (or any other panel study), microcensus data, Eurobarometer, the European and the World Value Survey, register data etc.  

I am a quantitative scholar. I welcome research projects that draw on small and large scale micro level data. I am, however, not restricted to any method of analysis. I also supervise qualitative projects in selected fields (migration and family behaviour).
