Survey research 
I lean more towards quantitative research but am open 

I supervise by colloquium but I do offer individual meetings too. I take single thesis topics, but I find that co-written theses are, on average, of a higher quality. In addition, I believe that students benefit from working with their colleagues. So, I strongly prefer co-authored theses, and I will take students willing to work in groups over single projects. Note that this does NOT mean you have to have someone in mind when you submit your proposal—it suffices if you indicate that you are willing to work with co-author(s). So please indicate in your proposal as to whether you are willing to work with another student(s). I should add that I do supervise a few individual theses. 

I will read and comment on your thesis proposal. I also encourage you to submit an outline, and updates of that outline, throughout the process. I never read drafts; when I read your thesis, I am reading it to grade it.
